# CS254-Final
Final project for CS254 Machine Learning by Gabriela Salazar Lopez, Chongqing Gao, Lichao Yang, and Isabelle Francke

Summary: Code for creating and evaluating a machine learning model that predicts the severity of depression based on patient data. 
We used the [2019 NHIS adult interview dataset](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2019nhis.htm) to train our model.
